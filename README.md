# FlexLM-Log-Parser
Parse Flex License manager debug logs for license usage info. 

To run this script make sure to place the debug file in the same folder as the VB Script and make sure it is named "debug.log". After that just double click the VB script and a file called "Autodesklog.csv" will be created containing usage data.
